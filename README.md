Born in Taranto, Italy, on 24/01/1995. Graduated in computer engineering. Passionate about software development and hardware components since childhood. I enjoy creating software for personal use and programming video games in my free time. I would like to pursue paths that allow me to grow and specialize in the field of Game Development. I want to work on ambitious, innovative, and above all, fun projects! I am a very curious person and I am attracted to things that stimulate my imagination and logic.

## Formation

### **Udemy - staying up to date**
I use Udemy to keep up to date on technologies, methodologies and development techniques, as well as learn new environments and new software, through the courses available and that pique my curiosity or interest.

### **DBGA - Game Programming Course** _- 2023/2024_
The path to the DBGA has been very useful from the perspective of learning about aspects related to game development such as programming languages (C++, C#), Unreal Engine and Unity, design patterns, implementations, tool usage, etc... Teaching method involved simulating what happens inside a development studio, thanks to group projects that simulated all the processes of game development, from conception to realization, from the prototype, through the vertical slice, to the presentation of the complete project. Furthermore, an equally important component was getting to know people, among students with whom to learn together, and trainers who demonstrated techniques and solutions for problems they had already faced through real examples and anecdotes.

### **Bachelor's Degree Computer Engineering** _- 2019/2022_
This degree fosters critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills essential for navigating the ever-evolving landscape of technology. It gave me the ability to dissect problems, devise efficient solutions, and adapt to emerging technologies is indispensable in a field where innovation is the norm. My thesis was "Cybersecurity nel Metaverso" (Cybersecurity in the Metaverse) in which i try to explain the critical problem of the Metaverse in software and hardware security.
